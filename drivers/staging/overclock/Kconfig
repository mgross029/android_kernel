	This project consists of a kernel module for OMAP3 phones with Android 
	to unlock any processor frequency/voltage combination and a companion 
	graphical app to ease the configuration. The phone must be rooted so 
	that the kernel module can be loaded.
	
	The module has an interface in /proc/overclock/* that allows enabling 
	and disabling of overclock in runtime without rebooting. No flashing of 
	custom roms or kernels is needed, since that is not even possible with 
	the Milestone, Droid X and others.
